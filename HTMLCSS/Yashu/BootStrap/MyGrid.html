    I believe that a trusting attitude and a patient attitude go hand in hand.
     You see, when you let go and learn to trust God, it releases joy in your life.
     And when you trust God, you're able to be more patient. Patience is not just about
     waiting for something... it's about how you wait, or your attitude while waiting.

      I never said I wanted a 'happy' life but an interesting one. From separation and loss,
      I have learned a lot. I have become strong and resilient, as is the case of almost every
      human being exposed to life and to the world. We don't even know how strong we are until
       we are forced to bring that hidden strength forward...

      I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did,
       but people will never forget how you made them feel....

      We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power
       to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us
       and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies.

  Peace is the beauty of life. It is sunshine. It is the smile of a child,
  the love of a mother, the joy of a father, the togetherness of a family.
  It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth.

  Let my soul smile through my heart and my heart smile through my eyes, that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts.

  A grateful heart is a beginning of greatness. It is an expression of humility. It is a foundation
   for the development of such virtues as prayer, faith, courage, contentment, happiness, love, and well-being.
